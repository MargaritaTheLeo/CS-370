Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

Working on the pirate treasure search game was a great experience. To complete this project, I implemented a Deep Q-Learning method which utilized two neural networks. Those methods were used in order for the "pirate" to identify the "treasure". The treasure was located in the lower right corner of the maze, whereas the pirate agent’s starting point was in the top left corner. The DQN, as opposed to a regular Q-Table that is manually populated, approximates the values of the Q-Table. The pirate agent decides a course of action to follow to solve the maze by considering these values.

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

The theoretical analysis of computer hardware and software is the focus of computer scientists. A computer scientist uses technological concepts like robotics, data science, and programming to develop or enhance computer systems and software. Unlike computer engineers, computer scientists do not always deal with hardware and applications. Furthermore, computer scientists become proficient in a variety of computational tools and programming languages in order to develop algorithms that address real-world issues.

Computer scientists frequently collaborate with cutting-edge tech firms to produce software solutions that facilitate simple access to technology and foster advancement across all domains. In addition, they could work as researchers to go further into a certain field of computer science, such as computational complexity theory, software engineering, computer vision, data structures, and computer vision. In addition to studying the theory and practice of computers and computing systems, computer scientists construct algorithms, develop new software and technologies, enhance computer performance, and build computational models. To tackle complicated issues, they could also operate in a range of sectors including technology, finance, healthcare, etc.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

Problem-solving is an important skill. We all have problems, big and small. And, as a rule, we find solutions to them in a random way. You may wonder what it means to think like a programmer. The first step of solving a problem as a computer scientist should be the understanding what the problem is and clearly definition of the criteria that indicate that it has been solved. Most difficult problems are difficult because they are not understood. How do you determine that you understand the problem? Simply, if you understand the problem, you can explain its meaning in simple language. Don't dive into a task without a clear plan, naively believing that you won't get bogged down in it. Structure your solution instead. Any method will be powerless if you don't have a step-by-step plan. Rash attempts are not acceptable in programming. Give your brain a chance to analyze the task and information. To make a good plan, answer the question: “Given the current point A, what steps are necessary to arrive at point B?”. This is probably the most important step on the list. Don't try to tackle a big task all at once as it's not easy. Instead, break it down into several smaller, easy-to-do tasks. And solve each subtask step by step, one by one. Start with the simplest one that is obvious to you or that you can solve with some effort. 

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

Given that computers have now penetrated extremely deeply into the life of human society, it is necessary to realize that computer ethics is a vital element in the use of relevant information technology and the technological solutions developed for it. Computer ethics addresses a wide variety of aspects of the interaction between human society and computer technology. The moral standing of computer scientists as a professional group in society is upheld by a set of obligations and behavioral standards that are part of their professional ethics. Within their field, computer scientists must cooperate and assist one another. This aids in guaranteeing a superior degree of professionalism and resolving intricate issues. It is expected of computer scientists to carry out their work with accountability and honesty. This entails data protection, confidentiality preservation, and equitable treatment of clients and coworkers. Professionals in information technology need to accept accountability for the outcomes of their work. This is crucial for managing systems, creating software, and guaranteeing data security. Computer scientists are expected to uphold universal moral principles including justice, honesty, and respect.
